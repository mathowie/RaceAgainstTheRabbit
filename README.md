Race Against the Rabbit
====================

This is Matt Haughey's entry for the Race Against The Rabbit class exercise. I decided to build upon the class demo in the following ways:

- added a very simple progress bar that fills in the width based on the position for each animal racing <a href="http://red-team-design.com/stylish-css3-progress-bars/">based on this CSS demo</a>
- the colors are determined by the animal name variables using <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colornames.asp">CSS named colors</a>
- a winner is declared at the end via javascript, along with a colored background
- expanded the function to include four "animals" racing, with variables selected to give all four different outcomes often

A live working demo of the code is here:
